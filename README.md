# Open-Circuit
It's a PureData VJ tool for human embodied interaction by attendees, using the Makey Makey.

This tool was created for the Open Circuit event series at Aisle 5 in Atlanta, GA, USA. 

Basically, along with physical connections drawn in pencil, humans can complete the circuit on the entire wall of
the music venue, mixing videos together and applying effects. 

It is based on older code of Blacki's and mine used in the OpenVJ project, and I probably should've forked it, but too late now. 

Its continued development will serve to improve and promote physical interaction with visuals at music events by
the audience, in a new way for people to experience music. Many updates and interfaces will be added to this, beyond
just the makey, so that the options people can employ in their own venues will be provided in the fashion of built-in
libraries.

PureData-extended is required to run the patch, and it's open source and fun to use as well. :)
